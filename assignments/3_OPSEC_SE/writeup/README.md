## Assignment Writeup

### Part 1 (40 pts)

Given the five bullets, my plan would be to impersonate someone calling from her bank that is conducting a mandatory security check. I am assuming that I can find her bank name through OSINT techniques or other hacking methods. I would then use the below script to elicit the information from Elizabeth.

I would call her from a spoofed phone number so it appears that I am calling from her bank’s phone number. I would find this online by visiting her bank’s website.

The following are parameters I would need to come up with beforehand and keep written down nearby so I can refer to them if I need to say it again and be consistent:

•	*my_fake_name*

•	*her_bank_name*

> Hello Elizabeth, this is {*my_fake_name*} calling from {*her_bank_name*}. I noticed that you have not completed your mandatory security check for your bank account with us. Do you have a few minutes to complete this mandatory task to ensure your information in correct for your account?

*(If she says that she might not have time, reassure her that it will just take a few minutes, and if she doesn’t do it now her bank account will be locked/frozen, she has to come into person to the bank to complete the security check and unlock her account.)*

> Great, I basically need to confirm that you really are Elizabeth Moffet.

> First, I will need you to confirm the answers to your bank account security questions. Could you verify with me your …

> … mother’s maiden name?

> … the city you were born in?

> … the name of your first pet?

*(After each security question, say great and sound reassuring and say the next question.)*

> Excellent, now I need you to confirm your account’s ATM pin number.

> Great, and finally, to make sure that nobody else is accessing your account, what browser do you primarily use on your computer? This will help us raise a flag if we see any suspicious activity.

> Great, so now your account’s mandatory security check is complete. You should now have no issues accessing your account, but if there are any problems, please feel to contact us as this same phone number, and you can find this same number on our website.

> Is there anything else with your account that I can help you with today?

> Thank you for choosing {*her_bank_name*} and have a great day!
