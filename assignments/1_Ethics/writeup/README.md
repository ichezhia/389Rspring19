### Part 2 (75 pts)

#### Background

First and foremost, as a large automobile manufacturer, our top priority is to develop quality automobiles with no known issues. If we release something with an issue unknowingly, it is our responsibility to release a TSB for that vehicle.
The security problems on the current ECU firmware could damage the car and endanger occupants, but only if the security is exploited. If the vehicle was not released yet, we would try to release the car with the part of the ECU that is exploitable disabled until the security issue is fixed. If that is not an option, we will have to postpone the release of the vehicle until the security issue is fixed.

#### What I Would Do

Since the vehicle is already released to the public, I would first let my boss know. This should then escalate in the company to point where owners of the vehicle are contacted to inform them of the security problem. We would provide a timeline of when the problem will be solved, then contact the owners of the vehicle again for the TSB. This information would also be passed to dealers, so people know of the issue prior to purchasing a vehicle. I would not directly let the public or consumer watchdogs know about the issue. However, it can be assumed that the news will spread eventually, and the security problem will become public knowledge.

If my company does not escalate the issue and let owners of the vehicle know or postpone the release of the vehicle if it’s not released yet, then I would try again to let my boss or other higher-ups in the company know about the issue and ensure they understand the severity of the problem. If still nothing happens, then I will quit working at the company for my own ethical reasons. I could become a whistleblower, but that usually results in limited legal protection, as non-disclosure agreements are broken, and it will affect my personal life. As I agreed to the non-disclosure agreements when working for the company, I legally cannot disclose information the company does not want me to. I may be ethically responsible for possible damages caused to people by the security problem, but I am not legally responsible.

*In a world with laws and corporations, one’s moral compass will not be able to guide them. But it can if you leave the corporate world.*

#### Counterargument

From a business perspective, the goal is to maximize profit. If I owned lots of the company’s stock or did not want the company to lose money because of disclosing information of the information of the security problem, thus leading to informing owners of the vehicle or delaying the release of the vehicle if it’s not released yet, then I would consider keeping the security problem a secret.

The big problem with not informing my company of the security problem is that eventually, the public is going to know about it. This can happen by someone else in the company exposing the problem, or a hacker exploiting the security problem thus forcing us to explain what happened. Even though it may seem that we can maximize profit by not exposing the issue, we actually will be better off being transparent and informing owners of the vehicle or delaying the release of the vehicle if it’s not released yet. In fact, if I found the security problem and didn’t say anything, then people got hurt and they found out that I knew about the problem and didn’t say anything, then I will be at risk of being fired. Therefore, it is always in my best interest to let the company know of the issue and leave the company if they refuse to be ethically considerate.
