## Assignment Writeup

### Part 1 (100 Pts)

I tried some commands from lecture like `objdump` and `readelf`, this didn't get me anywher.

Then I tried `strings locker`. This told me "sorry, use ida pro". I went and installed this on my host machine as instructed.

IDA > New (disassemble a file) > Binary File > 64-bit

Then it asked me to find the entry point. I played around with IDA, but couldn't seem to figure out anything like a flag.
