## Assignment Writeup

### Part 1 (90 Pts)

I started off by noticing the 0x in front of something that looked liked hex. This tells me that this is probably a number or something. I assumed it was an int. There are two of these. Then I see that there are some prints, so I added these to my C file. Then I see the xor, which is ^=. Then I see that there is a data section which provides the formatting for the print I already found, so I adjusted the formatting of my print statements accordingly.

```c
printf("your code here");
```

I figured I might as well run my C program to ensure I wrote it correctly and that it works.

### Part 2 (10 Pts)

Two variables are defined. Then they are printed. Then exponential operations are performed in various ways on the variables. Then they are printed again.
